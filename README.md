Denison University Data Analytics senior project focused on NBA and WNBA salary disparities.

## Shifting Courts: Pay Equity Between the NBA & WNBA in a Changing Economic Landscape

## Research Question
What factors explain the gender pay gap in professional basketball, and how do player performance and league revenue contribute to differences in salaries between the NBA and WNBA?

## Data Source
Spotrac (2024-2025 NBA Player Contracts – NBA Salary Database) and HerHoopStats (2024-2024 WNBA Salaries by Player – WNBA Salary Cap Database)

## Methods
Statistical Analysis:
Gini Coefficient and Lorenze Curve

Predictive Analysis:
Regression Models and Fixed Effects Model

Prediction:
NBA players will continue to earn significantly higher salaries than WNBA players, but that WNBA salaries will be more evenly distributed and will represent a slightly larger share of league revenue in 2024–2025 compared to 2019–2020 due to the league’s recent growth in popularity
